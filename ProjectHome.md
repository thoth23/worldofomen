World of OMEN is a multiplayer online game developed in DarkBASIC.

The original World of OMEN began development in June of 2004 and reached its second round of closed beta testing ("Ares Release") in August of 2009.  Since that time, World of OMEN has been re-coded from the ground up into a tutorial to show step-by-step how to build a large multiplayer online game using DarkBASIC.

This tutorial project was migrated from a private SVN repository to this Google Code repository on June 26th, 2010.

At least 31 hours of tutorials were created from June 26th, 2010 through April 25, 2011.  The code for each of these tutorials is contained in this repository -- each COMMIT to the repository represents about 1 hour of coding in DarkBASIC.

The main project site is maintained here:

IMPORTANT!!!  Development on this project is on-hold as of April 25, 2011 - however, this repository will continue to be available as long as Google continues to host it :)
