LanguageTagClassName1=Arbalest
LanguageTagClassDescription1=You are designed and built to annihilate your enemies at range, but you have almost no defensive capabilities.  Your programs gain more precision the longer you go without taking damage.  An arbalest can engage the enemy solo, but must be careful not to be overwhelmed by numbers.  In a regiment, Paladins and Skirmishers can effectively deflect incoming attacks, allowing you to focus on making more tactical strikes.
LanguageTagClassAttributes1=Health: Low\Damage: High\Accuracy: High\Defense: Average\Repair: None\Buff: None\Debuff: None
LanguageTagClassName2=Divinist
LanguageTagClassDescription2=In the center of your chassis, you house a micro-singularity containment system.  This experimental system is both extremely powerful and extremely volatile.  With it, the Divinist can see into the future, and even alter space and time to their advantage.  Divinist are difficult to run, but become extremely powerful at high levels.  A Divinist can engage enemies solo, but must take care to not let their own systems overwhelm them.  With a regiment, the Divinist's systems are buffered by the natural control fields that regiments generate - making their jobs much easier.
LanguageTagClassAttributes2=Health: Low\Damage: Low\Accuracy: Moderate\Defense: Good\Repair: Low\Buff: High\Debuff: None
LanguageTagClassName3=Engineer
LanguageTagClassDescription3=The Engineer specializes in field repair and maintenance of their own and their regiment's systems.  Even though you have access to a limited number of ranged weapons, you will frequently need to wade into the middle of a fire-fight to sample enemy attack schematics and generate counter-measures.  Because of this, you are equipped with light but effective arsenals and defensive systems.  Your diagnostic and repair systems keep your own chassis running smoothly, so you can engage enemies alone.  When engaging the enemy with a regiment at their side, however, Engineers can focus on keeping everyone running smoothly.
LanguageTagClassAttributes3=Health: Low\Damage: Moderate\Accuracy: Moderate\Defense: Moderate\Repair: High\Buff: Low\Debuff: None
LanguageTagClassName4=Paladin
LanguageTagClassDescription4=Paladins take the heat of battle with an elaborate array of defensive capabilities and massive frames that can withstand tremendous damage.  As long as a Paladin is engaging an enemy, their systems can provide double-buffering and additional control signals for others in their regiment.  Despite having no ranged weapons, a Paladin is extremely easy to run solo.
LanguageTagClassAttributes4=Health: High\Damage: Moderate\Accuracy: Moderate\Defense: High\Repair: None\Buff: None\Debuff: None
LanguageTagClassName5=Saboteur
LanguageTagClassDescription5=No system is secure... given enough time, and sufficient processing power.  Fortunately, Saboteurs frequently have one or both.  Every micrometer of the Saboteur's frame is lined with signal-processing, decryption, and re-coding circuits.  They can narrow-band to make an enemy hear a noise that isn't there, and then crank up the power to broadcast a massive assault that shreds enemy defensive programming.  Saboteurs can be played effectively alone, but they must pick their targets careful and work methodically when doing so.  With a regiment, Saboteurs are free to use more brute-force tactics.
LanguageTagClassAttributes5=Health: Low\Damage: Low\Accuracy: Moderate\Defense: Good\Repair: Low\Buff: None\Debuff: High
LanguageTagClassName6=Skirmisher
LanguageTagClassDescription6=If the frame is destroyed, the systems will be compromised - that is the Skirmisher's creed.  Skirmishers are designed to smash, crush, and dismantle their enemies as quickly and efficiently as possible.  The tremendous levels of power a Skirmisher must generate to do this, however, means that they can be susceptible to overheating when attacking continuously for too long.  A Saboteur's balanced design make them the easiest to play, and the easiest to play alone.  In a regiment, however, the Skirmisher can bolster both the damage output and the defensive capabilities of the group.
LanguageTagClassAttributes6=Health: Moderate\Damage: High\Accuracy: Good\Defense: Good\Repair: None\Buff: None\Debuff: None

LanguageTagPowerSourceName0=Fission
LanguageTagPowerSourceDescription0=Fission power sources convert matter into energy using brute-force methods.  A fission power source is more reliable than other power sources, but also provides no additional heat dissipation, noise reduction, or vibration dampening fields.  Fission power sources have near-perfect reliability.
LanguageTagPowerSourceName1=Antimatter
LanguageTagPowerSourceDescription1=Antimatter power sources slowly bring together particles and anti-particles so they mutually annihilate each other, releasing tremendous amounts of energy.  An antimatter power source can absorb radiant energy from its environment to initiate and sustain its reactor, allowing it to act as an effective heat sink for other nearby ADAM-2 units.  Antimatter power sources have high reliability.
LanguageTagPowerSourceName2=Chaos
LanguageTagPowerSourceDescription2=Power sources based on the laws of chaos manipulate the quantum states of particle pairs such that they exist in mutually-exclusive space.  This process creates a duality particle, which generates enormous surplus energy.  Power sources based on the laws of chaos can run in synchronous disharmonics with environmental noise, effectively creating a field of noise reduction for other nearby ADAM-2 units.  Power sources based on the laws of chaos have high reliability.
LanguageTagPowerSourceName4=Diamondoid Surfaces
LanguageTagPowerSourceDescription4=Power sources which derive their energy from the surface effects between mono-layer surfaces were one of the earliest technological breakthroughs of Adamanthian society.  The surplus energy ratio for diamondoid power sources has traditionally be too low to use as a viable field combat unit.  Recent advances in near-infinite surface objects, however, have changed all this.  The InfiniSpace module naturally generates a vibration dampening field for other nearby ADAM-2 units.  Diamondoid power sources have high reliability.
LanguageTagPowerSourceName7=Self-Evolving Systems
LanguageTagPowerSourceDescription7=The Self-Evolving Systems power source is primarily composed of a balanced culture of nanites that are programmed to evolve with sub-nanosecond generation intervals.  Invariably, these systems develop tremendous power-generating capacity, but the process of harvesting that energy destroys a significant portion of the culture in the process.  Self-Evolving Power Sources are less reliable, but can simultaneously provide heat dissipation, noise reduction, and vibration dampening fields for nearby ADAM-2 units.  Self-Evolving power sources have moderate reliability.
